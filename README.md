# Positive-impact-project
This is the first buddy project which will be an informative website that provides important information on how to have a positive impact on our planet. 

This is the skeleton for building the website. 
- Each section has a different and separate page. 
- Each section has its own style sheet named the same as the HTML file. 
- The color palette for the entire project is created under the :root method in the stylesheet for all sections.
