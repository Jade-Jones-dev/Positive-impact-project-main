                <h2>Prepare the ground:</h2>

                </p>Choose a dry day when the ground is not frozen or waterlogged, then dig a hole as deep as the root
                ball
                and two to three
                times as wide. Contrary to common advice, you should not add fertiliser or organic material to the
                planting
                hole. There
                is no evidence to suggest that they boost the tree, and sometimes may hinder new root growth.

            <section class="cards">
                <h2>Plant the tree:</h2>
                <p>Simply place the tree in the hole after removing any wrapping and pots. Spread the roots out and
                    settle the tree so that
                    the first flare (top layer) of roots sit level with the soil surface.
                    This is important because planting a tree too deeply prevents air from getting to the roots and
                    may rot the stem,
                    damaging or even killing the tree.
                    Carefully backfill the hole with soil in layers, firming in gently until the soil is level.
                    Avoid pressing down too hard
                    and compacting the soil - it should not feel solid.
                </p>

                <h2>Stake and water:</h2>
                <p>Any stem or trunk that is thicker than your thumb will need staking. A newly planted tree does
                    not have a deep enough
                    root system to protect it from being pulled out by strong winds.
                    You should push a stout wooden stake into the soil just outside of the root ball, leaning
                    backward at a 45-degree angle
                    to meet the trunk. Make sure the stake is deep and firmly fixed in the soil – use a wooden
                    mallet to drive it in.
                    Then gently tie the tree to the stake using soft tree ties. Make sure the ties do not cut into
                    the stem as it grows –
                    keep loosening them.</p>

            <p>
                Water in the tree really well. One of the most common problems with newly planted trees is
                drought. Water every few days
                during dry spells for the first growing season.
                Aside from watering, it is important to keep the soil around the tree clear of weeds. They grow
                roots near the surface,
                taking up vital water before it gets to the tree.
